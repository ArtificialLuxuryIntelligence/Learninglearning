# Log Book  -- Learninglearning
A log and overview of my progress as I learn web dev.

# 14/10/2019
TWO months into my web development learning. 

I haven't been using GitHub or Git much since learning how to use them about a month ago. I'll get my little projects uploaded here when I decide that they demonstrate ability rather than a lack thereof.. It is quite encouraging to look back on things I have made recently and realise quite how bad they are. I said encouraging.

The following recap of the first two months is from memory so it will not be exhaustive but it is probably helpful to understand my timeline to some extent (at least for me!).


## The second month:
Now I look at the list, I may have started some of these bits in the first month.

Of course, I haven't mastered JS at this point but I am now aware of the general concepts and how everything fits together. Most importantly, I can now fairly efficiently identify how to go about fixing my problems. (using docs/ref material/forums etc).

Naturally, as I now a have a better view of the landscape, I have a better view of everything I need to learn. Of course this is a good thing but at this point, I need to focus on my trajectory. I decided to put my learning of the back-end (Node, Express) on hold in favour of getting some solid front-end practice under my belt. I will set some time aside to learn Express etc. in the coming weeks but I should get also get a decent front-end portfolio for future employers to marvel at. My goal is full-stack and *I will power on*.

Happy with my progess so far. My focus on getting half decent at JS has lead to me ignore JQuery. I'll learn the basics now..

#### Possible plans for month 3: 
- Build/Upload simple flexbox/grid VanillaJS site - I should probably prove that I can use this stuff(I have some things from my first days learning - I hope they don't hurt to look at)
- Build/Upload simple React projects.(use Ant/Bootstrap/MaterialUI?)
- Deepen JS knowledge with YDKJS / Eloquent JS (*really* get my head around prototypal inheritance/promises etc)
- Learn React Routing (and more react stuff in general)
- The other thousand things I realise I don't actually know (I plan to loop back to consolidate my CSS (animations, preprocessor(SASS), flex, grid, general responsive design stuff, ...)


### What I learned:
- Plenty more Javascript concepts..
- - First look at more concepts:
- - Promises, Fetch API, Classes, Objects, Export/Import, Modules, High order array methods (map,filter, reduce..)
..etc (some better than others).
- ReactJS (decent grasp of basics but I need practice building things)
- Git 
- Github
- npm
- Webpack (not really used it)
- (started using some handy tools -Prettier,ESlint, live server)
- I used a couple of external APIs in small projects (weather, ongoing word project)
- I used a library (ascii converter project)

### Resources used:
- The Odin Project:
- -Web Dev 101 (majority - left a few bits out)
- - Javascript (majority - left a few bits out)
- - Node (very start - no express yet.. I stopped in favour of deepening my front-end knowledge for now - mostly React)
- Youtube (mostly Mosh, NetNinja, Traversy)
- FreeCodeCamp:
- - Responsive Web Design Certification 
- - Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification
- - Front End Libraries Certification (didn't do redux)
- CodeAcademy (React I&II)
- W3Schools
- javascript.info
- lots of blogs 
- - projects for advanced beginners (Robert Heaton blog)
- codewars

## The first month:
I am teaching myself and using only the finest resources available online. (That I can find. (So far) that are free). 
I started from scratch so I had to get to grips with the fundamentals. 

### What I learned:

- HTML (first look)
- CSS (first look)
- Javascript (first look)
- DOM
- (Atom text editor)

### Resources used:
- MDN docs
- Internettingishard
- W3Schools
- various blogs (more complete resource list to follow)
- CSSTricks
- Youtube (mostly Mosh, NetNinja, Traversy)
- various blogs

I've created this repo as a place to reflect on projects as a make them. I intend to go into some detail about particular bits of the code that I found tricky or time-consuming as well as more general feelings about my progress on the whole.
